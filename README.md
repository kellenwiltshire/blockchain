Simple Blockchain webapp made with Chakra UI and MobX

## Lessons Learned

I built this webapp as a simple project learn more about MobX for State Management (Super easy!) and to practice with ChakraUI. While there isn't a lot of UI or styling needed in this project, it was good to familiarize myself with its documentation.
